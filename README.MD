# Salty Crackers
This game is a test of the capacities of the new AI tools for programming, and a hobbie to navigate the struggles of pregnancy with a touch of humour.

## Release v0
The first release of the game is a simple platformer where the player controls a character that can jump and move left and right. The objective is to collect all the crackers scattered throughout the level while avoiding obstacles.
