# Salty Crackers
This game is a test of the capacities of the new AI tools for programming, and a hobbie to navigate the struggles of pregnancy with a touch of humour.

## Release v0
The first release of the game is a simple platformer where the player controls a character that can jump and move left and right. The objective is to collect all the crackers scattered throughout the level while avoiding obstacles.

## Release v1
The second release of the game adds more features and mechanics, such as a stamina system and a shop where the player can buy items to help them in their quest to collect crackers. The goal is to collect all the crackers as fast as possible while managing the character's stamina and using items strategically.
